<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kacchi Biryani is a fragrant, layered rice dish where raw, marinated meat (mutton or beef) is layered with partially cooked basmati rice and spices, then slow-cooked in a sealed pot (dum-style) until tender and flavorful, cooking in its own steam for deep flavor infusion.
Characterized by its rich aroma from yogurt, ginger-garlic, whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon), fried onions, ghee, and often potatoes, it's a staple of Bangladeshi cuisine, especially in Old Dhaka, known for its tender meat and aromatic rice.</p>
