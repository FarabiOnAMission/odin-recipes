<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food featuring thinly sliced, marinated meat (lamb, beef, chicken, turkey) stacked on a large, rotating vertical spit, slowly roasting as it turns.
    The cooked outer layers are shaved off and typically served wrapped in pita or flatbread with vegetables like tomatoes, pickles, and onions, and sauces such as tahini or garlic sauce. Its distinctive flavor comes from rich spices in the marinade, creating tender, succulent meat.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 lemons (1 juiced, 1 cut into wedges to serve)</li>
  <li>150g pot natural yogurt</li>
  <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>thumb-sized piece ginger, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>1-2 green chillies (depending on how hot you like it)</li>
  <li>small pack of fresh coriander</li>
  <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>16 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
  <li>1 large baking potato, cut in half lengthways</li>
  <li>6 shop-bought naan bread</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Tip all the ingredients, except the chicken and lemon wedges, into a blender or a smoothie bullet with 1 tsp sea salt and whizz to a smooth paste</li>
<li>Pile the chicken into a bowl or large plastic container, pour over the paste and mix through so the chicken is completely coated</li>
<li>Cover and marinate for at least 4 hrs or up to 48 hrs – the longer, the better.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Light a lidded barbecue, and let the flames die down.</li>
  <li>Once the coals have turned ashen, pile them up on one side with a few coals scattered around the other.</li>
  <li>Starting and ending with half a baking potato, thread all the chicken onto two long metal skewers – so that both skewers go through each piece of meat – packing the thighs down between the potato halves so that they are really compact.</li>
  <li>Place the large chicken kebab to the side of the barbecue with only a few coals underneath.</li>
  <li>Pop the lid down and cook for 45-50 mins, turning every 15 mins, or until cooked through – prise the chicken pieces apart in the centre to check, or use a digital cooking thermometer; it should read 70C or more.</li>
  <li>Leave to rest for 5 mins.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8.</li>
  <li>Sit the kebab across a roasting tin so it is suspended, or rest a wire rack over a roasting tin and place the chicken on top.</li>
  <li>Cook for 45-55 mins or until cooked through.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Warm the naan on the barbecue or in the oven.</li>
  <li>Bring the kebab to the table to carve, wrap with warm naans, and serve with the other salads and lemon wedges for squeezing over.</li>
</ol>
